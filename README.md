## Overview

This is the **backend service** for the **QC Lab Test Result Management System**, built with **ASP.NET Core MVC**. 
The application provides secure endpoints and internal services to manage laboratory test results.
The design follows SOLID principles with clean separation between controller logic, services, and data access layers.

The project demonstrates:
- Clean RESTful API architecture  
- Layered design (Controller → Service → Repository)  
- Dependency Injection and configuration management
